## Installation

Thatâ€™s it!

## Background
There's [a company called HaCon](https://hacon.de) that sells [a public transport management system called HAFAS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAFAS). It is [used by companies all over Europe](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/2b7ed83bfa5f115125a5) to serve routing and departure information for apps. All those endpoints are similar, with the same terms and API routes, but have slightly different options, filters and sets of enabled features.
